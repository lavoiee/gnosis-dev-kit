# Welcome to Gnosis Development Kit

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/gnosis/gnosis-dev-kit.svg)](https://gitter.im/gnosis/gnosis-dev-kit?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

A permissionless and decentralized platform built on Ethereum, Gnosis is the easiest way to aggregate relevant information from both human and AI sources into one number.

The Development Kit contains all you need to start creating your custom application on top of Gnosis.

The Gnosis platform is composed of four core components:

* [GnosisDB](/core-components/gnosisdb)
* [GnosisJS](/core-components/gnosisjs)
* [Gnosis Contracts](/core-components/gnosis_contracts)
* [Gnosis Management Interface](/core-components/management)

The Development Kit takes care of installing all necessary libraries,
it also runs TestRPC, a JSON RPC provider which is designed to ease developing Ethereum dapps,
as well as deploying all the Prediction Markets' smart contracts, running the Management Interface and GnosisDB.

All you need to do is to take a look at [GnosisJS](/core-components/gnosisjs) documentation and start coding.
